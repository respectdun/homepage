                        <h4>Street Fighter <span class="experience-span">(1987)</span></h4>
                        <p>In this game, the player plays as martial artist Ryu,
                            who competes in a worldwide martial arts tournament spanning five countries and 10
                            opponents.</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter II <span class="experience-span">(1991)</span></h4>
                        <p>Street Fighter II was the first one-on-one fighting game to give players a choice from a
                            variety of player characters with different moves, allowing for more varied matches. </p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter Alpha <span class="experience-span">(1995)</span></h4>
                        <p>Street Fighter Alpha 2 features all-new stages, music, and endings for some characters,
                            some of which overlap with those from the original Alpha. It also discards the Chain Combo
                            system in favor
                            of Custom Combos, which requires a portion of the Super Combo meter to be used.</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX <span class="experience-span">(1996)</span></h4>
                        <p>A sequel was released in 1998, Street Fighter EX2, developed for the ZN-2 hardware. Custom
                            combos were reintroduced and the character roster was expanded upon even further. In 1999,
                            EX2 also received an upgraded version,
                            Street Fighter EX2 Plus. A port of EX2 Plus was released for the PlayStation in 1999.</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter III <span class="experience-span">(1997)</span></h4>
                        <p>Street Fighter III: New Generation made its debut in the arcades on the CPS3 hardware in
                            1997</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter IV <span class="experience-span">(2008)</span></h4>
                        <p>The original Street Fighter IV game concept, Street Fighter IV Flashback, never made it past
                            the
                            proposal stage. In 2007, more than eight years since the release of Street Fighter III
                            3rd Strike for the
                            arcades, Capcom unveiled Street Fighter IV at a Capcom Gamers
                            Day event in London. Conceived as a direct sequel to the early Street Fighter II games </p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter V <span class="experience-span">(2016)</span></h4>
                        <p>Street Fighter V was released exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and PC, enabling cross platform
                            gameplay,
                            in 2016. In 2018, the game received a major update, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition and in
                            2019, Street Fighter V:
                            Champion Edition was released as downloadable content.</p>
                        <h4>Versus <span class="experience-span">(1996)</span></h4>
                        <p>Capcom also produced a series of similar crossover fighting games with rival fighting game
                            developer SNK Playmore. The games, produced by Capcom, include Capcom vs. SNK in 2000,
                            which features characters primarily from the Street Fighter and King of Fighters
                            series. </p>

                        <h3>Other appearances</h3>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX</h4>
                        <p class="cursive">The eternal challenger, Ryu. Will his battle ever end? Will his challenge
                            last through all eternity?
                            What is he searching for? Will he... "I just need to meet a man who is stronger than I
                            am."</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX Plus α</h4>
                        <p class="cursive">"I shall never rest as long as the fight vibrates within my mind." Ryu's
                            journey continues with no end in sight...
                            The Path of the True Warrior. Will he find an "answer" at the end of the road...?
                            He continues walking, believing in his own fist. The road he seeks is still a long way to
                            go."</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX2"</h4>
                        <p class="cursive">"Ryu realized that he needed to overcome himself and forge his mind with true
                            strength.
                            Returning to the old mountain home where he trained together with Ken and their mutual
                            master,
                            Ryu began his training all over again from a fundamental principle, forbidding himself from
                            using
                            the special moves he has learned.
                            Ryu strengthens himself with such a humble method, believing that it will someday guide him
                            to the end
                            of the fight and reveal the answer he has been seeking.
                            Tomorrow's Ryu could be you."</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX2 Plus</h4>
                        <p class="cursive">"Ryu was there, under the moonlight. He raises his own fist to the heavens.
                            "What should I grasp?"
                            The wind flows. Until the moment the answer he is looking for is found."</p>
                        <h4>Street Fighter EX3</h4>
                        <p class="cursive">"Ryu has always chosen the road less traveled on his quest for the ultimate
                            challenge.
                            And as he walks away he can only think of the most recent events of his life, 'What is the
                            purpose?
                            What is the point? How many more challenges must I overcome before I can feel like I have
                            accomplished my goal?
                            Maybe there is no answer,
                            and that is the point..."</p>

                        <h3>Biography</h3>
                        <h4>Concept</h4>
                        <p>In the early days of most Street Fighter media, Ryu often had a more "rough and tumble"
                            personality,
                            as well as a bit of a goofy and lighthearted side to him. He was also shown to be quite
                            irritable when hungry.
                            In his short story in the manga Street Fighter Gaiden, he was shown to be a rather happy
                            individual, a trait
                            common among shounen main characters, such as Son Goku from the
                            Dragon Ball series and Luffy from the One Piece series. Some of these traits are preserved
                            in modern portrayals.</p>
                        <h4>Appearance</h4>
                        <p>Ryu's most recognizable attire consists of a white karate gi with the sleeves torn off,
                            medium length hair, a
                            long red headband, a black martial arts belt and bare feet (a choice he makes of his own,
                            believing it to be more
                            comfortable. In many of his appearances, Ryu carries around a large,
                            white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets,
                            passports, and local currency.</p>
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>GRyu is a silent, meek, humble, submissive, self-deprecating, and respectful individual;
                            which is often juxtaposed against the light-hearted, fiery persona of his childhood friend,
                            Ken.
                            He wanders the world with the desire for complete mastery of his martial art, and takes both
                            his travels
                            and training seriously. For Ryu, the training and the mastery that comes from the fight are
                            all that he
                            requires for satisfaction, declining the more material trappings of his various
                            accomplishments as a warrior,
                            simply moving on to his next challenge once he is victorious without delay, unless he is
                            offered food or if he
                            wants to converse with his friendly rivals. Though he does not actively seek the role of a
                            hero, he possesses
                            a strong sense of justice as well; protecting the innocent against the predations of
                            bullies and tyrants is the one of the few things that Ryu will prioritize over a satisfying
                            fight.
