                        <h4>Concept</h4>
                        <p class="bio-p">In the early days of most Street Fighter media, Ryu often had a more "rough and
                            tumble"
                            personality,
                            as well as a bit of a goofy and lighthearted side to him. He was also shown to be quite
                            irritable when hungry.
                            In his short story in the manga Street Fighter Gaiden, he was shown to be a rather happy
                            individual, a trait
                            common among shounen main characters, such as Son Goku from the
                            Dragon Ball series and Luffy from the One Piece series. Some of these traits are preserved
                            in modern portrayals.</p>
                        <h4>Appearance</h4>
                        <p class="bio-p">Ryu's most recognizable attire consists of a white karate gi with the sleeves
                            torn off,
                            medium length hair, a
                            long red headband, a black martial arts belt and bare feet (a choice he makes of his own,
                            believing it to be more
                            comfortable. In many of his appearances, Ryu carries around a large,
                            white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets,
                            passports, and local currency.</p>
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p class="bio-p">Ryu is a silent, meek, humble, submissive, self-deprecating, and respectful
                            individual;
                            which is often juxtaposed against the light-hearted, fiery persona of his childhood friend,
                            Ken.
                            He wanders the world with the desire for complete mastery of his martial art, and takes both
                            his travels
                            and training seriously.Though he does not actively seek the role of a
                            hero, he possesses
                            a strong sense of justice as well; protecting the innocent against the predations of
                            bullies and tyrants is the one of the few things that Ryu will prioritize over a satisfying
                            fight.
